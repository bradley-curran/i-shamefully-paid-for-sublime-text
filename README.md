# I Shamefully Paid For Sublime Text

## Overview

This repository is a testament to my audacious and unapologetic act of shelling out some hard-earned cash for Sublime Text. That's right, I willingly parted with my money for a text editor. Brace yourself for this thrilling saga of financial irresponsibility.

## Why Sublime Text?

I mean, why not? It's a text editor that doesn't expect you to sacrifice a goat. It's like finding an inexplicable attachment to a text editor quietly waiting for you to discover its brilliance. No fanfare or confetti'sâ€”just a silent presence, pure, unadulterated functionality making itself indispensable. It's the kind of friend who never judges your messy code but helps you clean it up without a fuss.

## The Guilt Trip

For the longest time, I was living life on the edge, using Sublime Text without paying a single cent. Each "Ctrl + S" brought a pang of guilt, reminding me of my unpaid dues. It had been my loyal companion through thick and thin, and I had given it nothing in return. But here's the catch, Sublime Text casually shows you a dialog box with a reminder:

> "Would you like to purchase a license now?"

Polite. Innocent. But in reality, a guilt trip in digital disguise. A sarcastic, rhetorical question which actually says *"After limitlessly trying all my features, how about you do the right thing?"*

The guilt became too much to bear, and I finally gave in to the pressure. I paid for it, not because I had to, but because I wanted to make amends.

## What I Got

Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I must admit, my life didn't change dramatically after I paid for Sublime Text. Sure, the reminder was gone but there was no grand parade or fanfare. Instead, I received:

- A peculiar sense of satisfaction and embarrassment, all rolled into one
- The satisfaction of supporting a product that silently deserved recognition for equally supporting me for so long
- A license key, a digital souvenir to remind myself of my guilt trip

That's it! You've successfully read a story about someone who shamefully paid for Sublime Text. 
This repository stands as a monument to my somewhat questionable decision-making process, a reminder that even the staunchest proponents of free software can find themselves succumbing to a persuasive dialog box.

So, if you're still using Sublime Text for free, fear not, as you are in the majority. But if you ever find yourself in a moment of weakness, remember this story of a developer who shamefully paid for a text editor.
